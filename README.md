# Banned Terms
Automatically close issues that contain certain keywords. Created after observing 
the issues of a popular minecraft client's repository and being physically drained 
by the number of hapless 13-year-olds asking for a complete rewrite of the mod to 
the "Forge" modloader. If you have common, unrealistic things people constantly open
issues about, this could be your solution!
